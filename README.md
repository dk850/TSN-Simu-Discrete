# TSN-Simu-Discrete
Building a discrete-time TSN simulator in Python 3.9 in order to gather preliminary data for non-standard TSN theories and hypotheses. Contact me for any documentation.

Users should fork this framework and add their own functions and code changes. Most code changes will likely need be made to the main simulator file TSN_Simulator.py. Users can also submit pull requests to add any functions they feel would be valuable to the simulator.

"USER SETTINGS" section should be manually edited in order to give the simulator any desired behaviour as well as point it to any files one has created.



Simulator should not be used as conclusive evidence but can give a good idea of any hypotheses to validate future research.
